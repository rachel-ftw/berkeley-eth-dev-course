# Greeter Contract
Build a simple contract that "greets" the user.

As is common when learning any language for the first time, this is the *Solidity* equivalent to `Hello, world!` in other languages.

**All work should be done in Greeter_skeleton.sol**

## Rules
* The contract cannot be payable; if a user attempts to pay into the contract, they should have all their money refunded

## Minimum Requirements
* The contract must print a "greeting" to the console

## Extra Credit
* Keep track of the number of times the contract has sent out a "greeting"
* Have multiple possible greetings
